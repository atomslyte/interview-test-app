## Interview Test App

#### This is an implementation of the interview test given in a figma design created by [Anthony Onu]("https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthony-onu-1a2800136/")

#### Time Finished: 2hrs 30mins

#### I didn't implement the api because I was initially confused from the design. The API unfortunately does not return a list of movies without searching first and I was trying to implement the search by title feature before my 2hours ran out.The extra 30mins was for setting up netlify and the rest

#### See live demo [here]("https://luxury-blini-d2e3c8.netlify.app")
